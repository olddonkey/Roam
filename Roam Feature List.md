# Roam Feature List

## Background Story

I like Github, and I use it lot, just like I use Weibo, Wechat.

Not as Weibo/Wechat, Github doesn't have a full function client. The official Github client is a extension of basic Git desktop client.

I want to read Github timeline/issue/commits/Documents on a native client.

But I can't find one.

So, I decide to make one myself.

## Functions I need

* [ ] Github Activity Timeline
* [ ] Repositories info
* [ ] Issues related to me with native notification
* [ ] Pull requests I send and send to me

To do...
